	<ModelSummary>
		<Summary>Prior Authorization (PA) Small Language Model (SLM) is designed to assist SMEs while adjudicating/ submitting a PA request. The model is designed to re-imagine the PA decision-making process and make it quicker and more transparent. It incorporates human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms from SMEs for continuous improvement and accuracy enhancement.</Summary>
		<Keywords />
	</ModelSummary>
	<UsesAndDirections>
		<IntendedUseAndWorkflow>&#x200B;
- The solution is intended to augment payer PA back-office operations teams in getting their work done faster or in reducing PA denials for providers. The SLM automatically analyzes submitted documents and highlights specific sections containing relevant evidence, eliminating the need to read through all pages of documentation. This targeted approach substantially reduces review time and administrative burden.
- Additionally, the system provides valuable predictive capabilities at the point of submission, alerting submitting physicians about the probability of request approval
- The solution addresses PA requests by analyzing structured and unstructured data and supporting documentation</IntendedUseAndWorkflow>
		<PrimaryIntendedUsers>&#x200B;
- Healthcare professionals involved in prior authorization processes
- Users should have familiarity with prior authorization procedures, patient documentation and clinical guidelines such as Milliman, InterQual etc.</PrimaryIntendedUsers>
		<HowToUse>Our proprietary SLM model comes ready to deploy out-of-the-box, delivering immediate value with minimal setup. For organizations seeking a personalized touch, users can fine-tune the model on their data while maintaining complete data privacy and ownership. Whether you choose the base model, a custom-tuned version, or the full Digital Worker solution, everything is accessible through secure API endpoints in our HIPAA-compliant Penguin platform.</HowToUse>
		<TargetedPatientPopulation>General patient population requiring PA for healthcare services. No specific exclusion criteria based on demographic factors</TargetedPatientPopulation>
		<CautionedOutOfScopeSettings>Not intended for decision-making without human review and should not be used as the sole basis for prior authorization decisions. Also, any changes in medical guidelines and criteria has to be updated on a regular basis</CautionedOutOfScopeSettings>
	</UsesAndDirections>
	<Warnings>
		<KnownRisksAndLimitations>&#x200B;
- Accuracy of the model improves with usage
- Places high weightage to human input during RLHF
- Performance dependent on quality of OCR of input clinical notes
- May not capture rare or unusual clinical scenarios</KnownRisksAndLimitations>
		<KnownBiasesOrEthicalConsiderations>Potential data biases inherited from training data</KnownBiasesOrEthicalConsiderations>
		<ClinicalRiskLevel>Low</ClinicalRiskLevel>

			<Security>&#x200B;
- **Accreditation**: HIPAA compliance, SOC-2 compliance, Hi-Trust compliance
- **Security and Compliance Practices**:
  1. Robust Data Protection mechanism including data encryption at rest and in transit using industry-standard protocols.
  2. Multi-tenant architecture is crucial for proper client data segregation, supplemented by strict access controls and identity management.
  3. Network security should implement segmentation, zero-trust architecture, and multiple security layers including VPNs, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.</Security>
			<Transparency>&#x200B;
- Human-in-the-loop review process
- Documented feedback collection and incorporation
- Model outputs not just the decision but also the reason (supporting evidence within the document) for the decision</Transparency>
